When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to work on a project from multiple computers, to enable more people to work on a 
project or to simply make a backup of your files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If a file is pulled that you currently work on /have not saved yet you might lose it
